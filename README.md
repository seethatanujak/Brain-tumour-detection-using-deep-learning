The Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning project focuses on developing an automated system to accurately classify brain scans (MRI images) as tumor-positive or tumor-negative. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model is trained on a dataset of labeled images, allowing it to automatically learn and extract key features associated with brain tumors. This deep learning approach enhances diagnostic accuracy by identifying complex patterns in medical images that may be difficult for the human eye to detect.

The project aims to provide early detection of brain tumors, which is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Ultimately, the project provides a non-invasive, efficient, and scalable solution to assist radiologists in diagnosing brain tumors.
